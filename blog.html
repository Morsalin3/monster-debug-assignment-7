       <h4>1. Difference of Local Starage and Session Storage ?</h4>
       <p><strong>ans :</strong>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
       </p>
       <h4>2. Difference or Global Scope and Block Scope ?</h4>
       <p><strong>ans : Global Scope:</strong> When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. 
        <p><strong>Block Scope:</strong> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.</p>

       <h4>3. How to Work Javascript Event Loop ? </h4>
       <p><strong>ans :</strong>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” <b>to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue</b>. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
